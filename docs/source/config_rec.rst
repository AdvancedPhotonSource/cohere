==========
config_rec
==========
| The "config_rec" defines parameters used during reconstruction process.
| Parameters are grouped by the function (feature) they are utilized for. There is a group of parameters that are not associated with any feature, and thus, we call them 'general'.
| The features are controlled by triggers. If trigger is defined then the feature is active and related parameters are used when processing the feature. The section below explains how to configure a trigger.

Trigger
=======
| Trigger can be defined as a single iteration, or multiple iterations.
| examples:
| (3) trigger at iteration 3
| (20, 5) trigger starts at iteration 20, repeats every 5 iteration for the rest of run
| (20, 5, 40) trigger starts at iteration 20, repeats every 5 iteration until iteration 40
| Triggers can also be a combination of any of the above, ex: ((4), (3, 7, 24), (6,20))
  
Parameters
==========
General
+++++++
- data_dir:
| optional, used for specific cases. Driven by the scripts, the experiment directory contains four directories: conf, prep, data, and results. The  data is read from <experimenr_dir>/data directory. If the data_dir parameter is configured then the data is read from this directory.
| example:
::

    data_dir = "/path/to/data_dir/data_dir"

- save_dir:
| optional, used for specific cases. Driven by the scripts, the experiment directory contains four directories: conf, prep, data, and results. The  reconstruction results are saved in <experimenr_dir>/results directory. If the save_dir parameter is configured then the data is saved in this directory.
| example:
::

    save_dir = "/path/to/save_dir/save_dir"

- cont:
| optional, if set to true the reconstruction starts with previous results stored in continue_dir (next configuration parameter). 
| example:
::

    cont = false

- continue_dir:
| must be defined if the "cont" parameter is set to true. Directory from which initial guess, initial support are read for reconstruction continuation. If the directory contains multiple subdirectories with initial guesses, a thread will start for each subdirectory.

::

    continue_dir = "/path/to/previous_results_dir/previous_results_dir"

- algorithm_sequence:
| mandatory, defines algorithm applied in each iteration during modulus projection by a sequence of lists. The first number in a list is a repeat, followed by lists of pairs, each pair defining algorithm and number of iterations to run the algorithm.

::

    phase_max = 1.57

Partial coherence
+++++++++++++++++
| Partial coherence triggers recalculation of coherence array for the amplitudes in reciprocal space. After first coherence array is determined, it is used for convolution in subsequent iteration.

- pcdi_trigger:
| defines when to update coherence using the parameters below.
| example:
::

    pcdi_trigger = (50, 50)

- partial_coherence_type:

Low resolution
++++++++++++++
| When this feature is activated the data is multiplied by Gaussian distribution magnifying the area with meaningful information and the sigma parameter used in calculation of support is modified gradually. The low resolution trigger is typically configured to be active at the beginning iterations and resume around the mid-run. Thus for the remaining iteration the data used in reconstruction is not modified.
- resolution_trigger:
| defines when to apply low resolution using the parameters below. Typically the last trigger is configured at half of total iterations.
| example:
::

    resolution_trigger = (0, 1, 320)

The multiplier array is a gauss distribution calculated with sigma of linespaced det across the low resolution iterations. If only one number is given, the last det will default to 1.
| example:
::

    iter_res_det_range = (.7)

averaging
+++++++++
| When this feature is activated the amplitudes of the last several iterations are averaged.
- average_trigger:
| defines when to apply averaging. Negative start means it is offset from the last iteration
