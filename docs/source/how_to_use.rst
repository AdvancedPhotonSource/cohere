| The user scripts can be obtained from https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/cdisupp. The cdisupp package, is a supplemental git repository that contains executable python scripts for every stage a CDI phase retrieval, from raw data processing to final images. A directory with sample configuration files for each stage, and a complete example including experimental data, experiment data, and configuration files to phase the data. The next section provides instruction on how to install the scripts. Part of the supplemental package are classes encapsulating instruments that are used to collect experiment data at the 34-ID-C beamline. User can easily add own code that would encapsulate user's beamline instruments.

Installing Scripts
##################
| There are three ways to get the cdisupp package onto your local computer, or remote computer if you are working this way.

- The cdisupp package can be downloaded as a zip file by visiting https://github.com/advancedPhotonSource/cdisupp and clicking the green “Code” button and selecting “Download ZIP” as shown below.

- Alternatively one can clone the repository using git. This will create the cdisupp-main directory containing all of the cdisupp content. It will also then have version control allowing you to keep track of changes as you practice running the programs, should you want to. (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).
git clone https://github.com/advancedPhotonSource/cdisupp cdisupp-main 

- Another way to get the cdisupp package on your machine is with the wget command:
     ::

        wget https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/cdisupp/archive/main.zip
        unzip main.zip

Scripts
####### 
| In this documentation it is assumed the scripts are invoked from cdisupp directory. Below is a list of scripts with description and explanation how to run:

- create_experiment.py

  This script creates a new experiment directory with conf subdirectory. The conf contains all configuration files. The files contain all parameters, but most of them commented out to make them inactive. User needs to edit the configuration files and un-comment to use wanted functionality.
  Running this script:
  ::

        python scripts/create_experiment.py <id> <scan range> <working_dir> --specfile <specfile>

  The parameters are as follows:
     * id: an arbitrary literal value assign to this experiment
     * scan range: scans that will be included in the data. This can be a single scan or range separated with "-"
     * working_dir: a directory where the experiment will be created
     * specfile: optional, but typically used

- setup_34idc.py

  This script creates a new experiment directory structure.
  Running this script:
  ::

        python scripts/setup_34idc.py <id> <scan range> <conf_dir> --specfile <specfile> --copy_prep

  The parameters are as follows:
     * id: an arbitrary literal value assign to this experiment
     * scan range: scans that will be included in the data. This can be a single scan or range separated with "-"
     * conf_dir: a directory from which the configuration files will be copied
     * specfile: optional, used when specfile configured in <conf_dir>/config file should be replaced by another specfile
     * copy_prep: this is a switch parameter, set to true if the prep_data.tif file should be copied from experiment with the <conf_dir> into the prep directory of the newly created experiment

- run_prep_34idc.py

  To run this script a configuration file "config_prep" must be defined in the <experiment_dir>/conf directory. This script reads raw data, applies correction based on physical properties of the instrument, and optionally aligns and combines multiple scans. The prepared data file is stored in <experiment_dir>/prep/prep_data.tif file.
  note: when separate_scan is configured to true, a prep_data.tiff file is created for each scan.
  Running this script:
  ::

        python scripts/run_prep_34idc.py <experiment_dir>

  The parameters are as follows:
     - experiment directory: directory of the experiment space

- format_data.py

  To run this script a configuration file "config_data" must be defined in the <experiment_dir>/conf directory, and the "prep_data.tif" file must be present in experiment space. This script reads the prepared data, formats the data according to configured parameters, and produces data.tif file. The file is stored in <experiment_dir>/data/data.tif file.
  Running this script:
  ::

        python scripts/format_data.py <experiment_dir>

  The parameters are as follows:
     * experiment directory: directory of the experiment space

- run_rec.py

  To run this script a configuration file "config_rec" must be defined in the <experiment_dir>/conf directory, and the "data.tif" file must be present in experiment space. This script reads the data file and runs the reconstruction software. The reconstruction results are saved in <experiment_dir>/results directory.
  note: The results might be saved in different location in experiment space, depending on the use case. Refer to 'Experiment' section for details.
  Running this script:
  ::

        python scripts/run_rec.py <processor> <experiment_dir> --rec_id <alternate reconstruction id>

  The parameters are as follows:
     * processor: the library used when running reconstruction. Possible options:

       + cuda
       + opencl
       + cpu

       The "cuda" and "opencl" options will invoke the processing on GPUs, and the "cpu" option   on cpu. The best performance is achieved when running cuda library, followed by opencl. 
     * experiment directory: directory of the experiment space
     * rec_id: optional parameter, when present, the alternate configuration will be used to run reconstruction

- run_disp.py

  To run this script a configuration file "config_disp" must be defined in the <experiment_dir>/conf directory, and the reconstruction must be completed. This script reads the reconstructed files, and processes them to create .vts files that can be viewed utilizing visualization tools such Paraview. The script will process "image.npy" files that are in the experiment space and in a subdirectory of "resuls_dir" configuration parameter, or a given file is --image_file option is used.
  Running this script:
  ::

        python scripts/run_disp.py <experiment_dir> --image_file <image_file>

  The parameters are as follows:
     * experiment directory: directory of the experiment space
     * image_file: optional parameter, if given this file will be processed.

- everything.py

  To run this script all configuration files must be defined. This script runs the cosequitive scripts: run_prep_34idc.py, format_data.py, run_rec.py, and run_disp.py. The experiment space must be already defined. 
  Running this script:
  ::

        python scripts/everything.py <processor> <experiment_dir> --rec_id <alternate reconstruction id>

  The parameters are as follows:
     * experiment directory: directory of the experiment space
     * processor: the library used when running reconstruction.
     * rec_id: optional parameter, when present, the alternate configuration will be used to run reconstruction

- cdi_window.py

  This script starts GUI that offers complete interface to run all the scripts described above. In addition GUI interface offers easy way to modify configuration.
  Running this script:
  ::

        python scripts/cdi_window.py
